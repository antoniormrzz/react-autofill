# React Autofill component

A react autofill component with loading, chips, and some other stuff.

Features that didn't make the cut since this is a tiny project:
- A ton of more options for the components (disabled, optionally controlled state, etc)
- Class name management (We will be using each component once, no need for flexibility)
- Linting (attributes on the same line, bla bla), relying on the default lint rules

- Why is App.tsx so messy? Answer: Put me in intergallactic jail.
